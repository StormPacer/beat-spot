## What is Beat Spot?

Beat Spot is a website tool that converts a Spotify playlist into a Beat Saber playlist. It also has some other options like download all current Noodle, Chroma, Ranked, etc. maps.

## How does it work?

On the site, click on "Spotify to playlist" and input what the minimum map rating should be, what the name of the playlist should be and lastly your Spotify playlist link. Then wait patiently until the request is processed. **It takes about 23 seconds to parse 100 songs, keep that in mind when inputting large playlists!**

## Limits

Beat Spot can't process a lot of requests per user so the "Spotify to playlist" feature is limited to 3 playlists per minute.
